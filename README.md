# Excel Challenge 
This is Excel Challenge from first week

## Overview of the project 
Analyse whether campaigns/shows have meet their financial goals for crowd-funded projects

## Analysis and Challenge
- Analyse outocme based on Category, Goals and LaunchDate
- Challenges: 
	- learning excel and functions
	- copy pasting goal range ws tedious. Wish I could use a formula to break the goal range and getb it populated 

## Results 
### Theatre outcome by Launch Date 
- It more likely to be successful when released in summer between April and August
- Shows are not cancelled in October even when failure rate is high

### Outcom based on Goals
- Percentage of Success increases when Goal amount decreases. So, for better success, its better to keepn the goal amount less.
